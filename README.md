# pRotectionism
An R package dedicated to bringing protectionist policies to your code

To extend the time a function completes use the taRiff() function. For Example:

```taRiff(function() print("Hello, world!"), 5)```

Or if you'd like to go to the next level you can remove all imported libraries using:

```autaRky()```
